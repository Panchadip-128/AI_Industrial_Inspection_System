# AI Industrial Inspection System (In Progress)
-----------------------------------------------
AI-based autonomous system that uses computer vision and deep learning to detect faults in industrial machinery or pipelines using drones or robotic systems.
Incorporating reinforcement learning for navigation, use advanced object detection models (like YOLOv8 or Mask R-CNN), and implement real-time anomaly detection

Application: Autonomous monitoring of large-scale industrial plants, reducing human risk and error. Give complete code and dataset to be used name and link
